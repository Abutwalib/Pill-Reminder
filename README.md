So sick yet so busy. This is the least possible way you can describe most of us currently.
We walk around looking healthy but we have several diseases ailing us.
Arent there times that youve been so held up to the point where you forget getting your meds even those that require to be taken at a specified time?
well that is what this android application sought to solve.
get updates immediately when it is time, you have the flexibility of changing times to later, doctors can be booked and they can track their appointments from
this application.
Feel free to fork, suggest changes and contribute.
